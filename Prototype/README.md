University Ride Share – Project Prototype
Overview

This prototype showcases the conceptual design and user interaction flow of the University Ride Share System. It is intended to demonstrate how the system would function in a real-world university setting, focusing on usability, workflow, and future scalability.

The prototype acts as a visual representation of the system’s planned graphical interface, complementing the existing backend logic implemented in the project.

Purpose of the Prototype

The objectives of this prototype are to:

Visualize the interaction between students and the ride-sharing system

Illustrate the end-to-end user flow, from registration to ride matching

Present a potential graphical user interface for a future web or mobile application

Support academic evaluation, project proposals, and presentations

Implementation Notes

The current version of the project is implemented as a C++ console-based application, emphasizing core functionality and system logic

This prototype represents a future user interface extension, translating the console-based system into a graphical format for enhanced user experience
