# University Ride Share – Project Prototype Overview

## Overview

This prototype showcases the conceptual design and user interaction flow of the **University Ride Share System**. It demonstrates how the system is intended to operate in a real-world university environment, with a focus on usability, workflow efficiency, and future scalability.

The prototype serves as a visual representation of the system’s planned graphical user interface, complementing the existing backend logic implemented in the project.

## Purpose of the Prototype

The primary objectives of this prototype are to:

- Visualize interactions between students and the ride-sharing system  
- Illustrate the complete user flow, from registration to ride matching  
- Present a potential graphical user interface for a future web or mobile application  
- Support academic evaluation, project proposals, and formal presentations  

## Implementation Notes

- The current version of the project is implemented as a **C++ console-based application**, focusing on core functionality and system logic  
- This prototype represents a planned **future user interface extension**, translating the console-based system into a graphical format for an improved user experience
