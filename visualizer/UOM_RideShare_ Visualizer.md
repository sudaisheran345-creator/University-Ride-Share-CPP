## UOM SharRider Visualizer

The **UOM SharRider Visualizer** serves as a conceptual and visual representation of the UOM SharRider C++ application. It provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the system’s core logic, workflow, and objectives, allowing readers to understand the project without directly examining the source code.

The visualizer explains **what the program does**, **why it was developed**, and **how it operates internally**, including the interaction between the different components of the system. By translating the underlying C++ implementation into a clear and easy-to-follow visual format, it makes the project accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Purpose of the Visualizer

The primary motivation behind creating this visualizer is to enable viewers to quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the application within a short period of time. Rather than reading and interpreting approximately **300 lines of C++ code**, users can rely on the visual explanation to clearly understand the system’s goals, logical flow, and real-world relevance.

### Impact and Documentation Value

Overall, the UOM SharRider Visualizer enhances code transparency, improves project comprehension, and demonstrates thoughtful documentation practices. It reflects our intention to develop not only a functional software solution, but also a well-documented, user-friendly, and academically sound project.
