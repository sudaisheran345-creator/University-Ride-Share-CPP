**UOM SharRider Visualizer
**
The UOM SharRider Visualizer serves as a conceptual and visual representation of our C++ application. It acts as a summarized overview of the core logic, workflow, and objectives of the system, allowing viewers to understand the program without directly analyzing the source code.

This visualizer explains what the program does, why it was developed, and how it operates internally, including the interaction between different components of the system. It effectively translates the underlying C++ implementation into an easy-to-follow visual format, making the project more accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

**The primary motivation behind creating this visualizer **is to enable others to quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the application within a short period of time. Instead of reading and interpreting approximately 300 lines of C++ code, users can rely on the visual explanation to clearly understand the system’s goals, logic flow, and real-world impact.

Overall, the UOM SharRider Visualizer enhances code transparency, improves comprehension, and demonstrates thoughtful project documentation. It reflects our intention to build not only a functional software solution, but also a well-explained and user-friendly academic project.
